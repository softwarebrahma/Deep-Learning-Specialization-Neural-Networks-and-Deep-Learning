in this video and show you a slightly more complex example where the slope of the function can be different at different points in the function the start of an example here I plot to the function f of a equals a squared let's take a look at the point in equals two so a squared or F of a is equal to four let's nudge a slightly to the right so now a is equal to two point zero zero one f of a which is a squared is going to be approximately four point zero zero four it turns out that the exact value if you call the calculator and figure this out is actually four point zero zero four zero zero one now I'm just to say a 4.04 is close enough so what this means is that when a is equal to two let's plot that here so if this is a is equal to 2 F of a is equal to four but when I know a little bit to the right to point zero one then it goes up to the x and y-axes are not to scale here then it goes up to about four point zero zero four again the x and y-axes here are not drawn to scale let's draw this on the plot so what we're saying is that if a is equal to 2 then F of a is equal to 4 and here at the x and y axes are not drawn to scale technically this vertical height should be much higher than this horizontal height so the x and y axes are not on the same scale um but if I now notch a to 2 point 0 1 then F of a becomes roughly 4.04 so if you draw this little triangle again what this means is that if I Knight a 2 divided by 0.001 f of a goes up four times as much by 0.04 so in the language of calculus we say that the slope that is the derivative from F of a at a equals 2 is 4 or to write this out without calculus notation we say that Dda of f of a is equal to 4 when a is equal to 2 now one thing about this function f of a equals a square is that the slope is different for different values of a this is different and the example we saw on the previous slide so let's look at a different point if n is equal to 5 so 7 equals 2 in R 3 equals 5 then a squared is equal to 25 so that's F of a if I know 8 to the right again time you don't actually so now a is 5 point 0 1 then F of a will be approximately 25 point 0 1 0 so what we see is that by nudging a up by 0.001 F of a goes up 10 times as much so we have that d da f of a is equal to 10 when a is equal to 5 because F of a goes up 10 times as much as a does when I make a tiny little nudge to a so one way to see why the derivative is different at different points is that if you'd rule that need a little triangle right at different locations on this you see that the ratio of the height of the triangle over the width of the triangle is very different at different points on the curve so here the slope is equal to 4 when a is equal to 2 but is equal to 10 when a is equal to 5 now if you pull up a calculus textbook a calculus textbook will tell you that DTA of f of a so f of a is equal to a square so that DG a of a squared 1/2 the formulas you find that the calculus textbook is that this thing the slope of the function a squared is equal to 2a not going to prove this but the way you find yours out is that you open up a calculus textbooks to the table formulas and I'll tell you the derivative of two of a squared is equal to 2a and indeed this is consistent with what we've worked out mainly when a is equal to 2 the slopes of function to a is 2 times 2 is therefore equal to 4 and when a is equal to 5 then the slope of the function 2 times 8 is 2 times 5 is equal to 10 so if you ever pull up a calculus textbook and you see this formula that the derivative of a squared is equal to 2a all that means is that for any given value of a if you nudge it up with by 0.001 already your tiny little value you would expect F of a to go up by 2a that is the slope or the derivative times however much you had an urge to the right the value of 8 now one tiny little detail you know I have used these approximate symbols here and this wasn't exactly 4.04 there's an extra 0.001 hanging out there it turns out that this extra 0.001 this little thing here is because we were nudging a to the right by 0.001 if we're instead nudging it to the right by this new info testimony small value then this extra ever term will go away and you find that the amount that f of a goes up is exactly equal to the derivative times the amount that you now chained to the right and the reason why is not 4.04 exactly is because derivatives are defined using these insert' is very small not just to a rather than you know 0.001 which is well and while 0.001 is small is not info testimony small so that's why the amount that effort where it went up isn't exactly driven by the formula but is only kind of approximately driven by the derivative to wrap up this video let's just go through a few more quick examples the example you've already seen is that if F of a equals a squared then in calculus textbooks formula table will tell you that the derivative is equal to 2a and so the example we went through was that if a is equal to 2 F of a equals 4 and if we nudge a so it's a little bit bigger then F of a is about 4.04 and so f of a went up four times as much and indeed when a is equal to 2 the derivative is equal to 4 let's look at some other examples let's say instead 2 f of a is equal to aq if you go to a calculus textbook and look up the table formulas you see that the slope of the function again the derivative of this function is equal to 3a squared so you can get this formula out of a calculus textbook so what this means so the way to interpret this is as follows let's take a close to as an example again so f of a or a cubed is equal to 8 does 2 to power 3 so if we give a tiny little lunch you find that F of a is about eight point zero one two and feel free to check this take two point zero zero one two three you find that is very close to eight point zero one two and indeed when a is equal to 2 that's 3 times 2 squared that's equal to 3 times 4 is equal to 12 so the derivative formula predicts that if you now shade to the right by time a little bit F of a should go up 12 times as much and indeed this is true when a 1 to 5 point over 1 F of a went up 12 times as minus 5.01 - just one last example and then we'll wrap up let's say the F of a is equal to the log function right so I'm going to write log of a and I'm going to use a system base a logarithm so some people write that as log 1 of a so if you go to calculus textbooks you find that when you take the derivative of log of a and so this is a function that just looks like that the slope of this function is given by 1 over a so the way to interpret this is that if a is any value again let's just keep using equals 2 as an example um and you nudge a to the right by 0.001 you would expect F of a to go up by 1 over a that is by the derivative times the amounts then you increase a so in fact um if you plug the calculator you find that as a is equal to 2 F of a is about 0.6931 5 and if you increase F and if you increase a to 2 point over 1 then F of a is about 0.693 6 5 so it's gone up by 0.0005 d-did you look at the formula for the derivative when a is equal to 2d da F of a is equal to 1/2 so this derivative formula predicts that if you pump up a by 0.001 you will expect F of a to go up by only one half as much and one half 0.001 is 0.005 which is exactly what we got right then when a goes up by 0.001 going from a close to two equals two point zero one F of a goes up by half as much things are going up by approximately 0.05 so we draw that little triangle if you will is that if on the horizontal axis goes up by 0.001 under vertical axis log of a goes up by half of that so over five and so that 1 over a 1/2 in this case when a is equal to 2 that's just the slope of this line when a is equal to 2 so that's it for derivatives there's just two take-home messages from this video first is that the derivative of the function just means the slope of a function and the slope of a function can be different at different points on the function in our first example where F of a equals 3 a those a straight line the derivative was the same everywhere it was 3 everywhere but for other functions like F of a equals a squared or ever equals log of a the slope of the line via reason so the slope or the derivative can be different at different points on the curve so does the first take away derivative just means slope of a line second takeaway is that if you want to look up the derivative of a function you can flip open your calculus textbook or look at Wikipedia and often get a formula for the slope of these functions at different points so that I hope you have an intuitive understanding of derivatives or slopes of lines let's go into the next video we'll start to talk about the computation graph and how to use that to compute derivatives of more complex functions
